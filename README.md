# Cycle 7
## Project Description
The goal this cycle was to create a server/client environment that would automatically setup and configure a Wireguard VPN to enable communication.

## Reason
I spent some time playing with Wireguard in a previous course and really enjoyed it, but became frustrated with the tool's interface and documentation. I wanted to create something that utilized Wireguard but kept as many of the command details hidden from the user as possible. 

An additional artifact from this work is a Golang module for wireguard. It currently implements minimal functionality, but it separates the needed functionality of wireguard from using the client/servers themselves.
